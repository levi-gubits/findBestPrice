Best price (findbestprice.net)

A web based service that allows the user to search for a productâ€™s best price. 

The system searches for the best price in REAL TIME in tens of online stores using search agents that I have created. The system tells the user where he can get the product at the cheapest price. 

The user may specify a target price, in which case the system will continue to search for the best price for this product until it finds it with the target price. The user will be notified with an email containing a link to the product page in the relevant store.
